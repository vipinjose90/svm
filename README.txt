Run SVM.sh and the program should run automatically.

In order to run the program that calculates the information gain at each node and creates discretization splits, please uncomment "rf2.startRandomForest();" in the main class. I am also using another discretization method which I have uncommented.
The last program would take a long time to execute since N=100.

In order to change any parameters: refer to each java file: there are configurations on the top that can be edited. All comments have been mentioned. I am using all default values.
